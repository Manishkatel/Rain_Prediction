# Rain Prediction Web App | Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib , PyCaret , Scikit-learn, Flask, Heroku
  In this project I have:
- Built and deployed a machine learning-driven web app to predict rainfall using models like 
  XGBoost and GaussianNB
- Conducted data analysis, handled missing values with random sample imputation and used one-hot 
  encoding.
- Enhanced model accuracy using feature engineering techniques, and automated model selection with 
  PyCaret's AutoML and deployed the final model via Flask and hosted for real it on Heroku -time 
  predictions
